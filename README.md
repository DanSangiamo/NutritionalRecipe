# KnowCal
For our project we made a java console application.  The application allows users to enter in their recipes and receive
nutritional info for each one.  Additionally, the application forces the user to guess the number of calories in their 
recipe, with the goal of them becoming more aware of the amount they consume on a day to day basis.  Once the user
has been shown the nutritional info for their recipe, we search for lower calorie substitute ingredients for the highest
calorie ingredient in their recipe.  If one is found, the user is asked if they would like to make the substitution.  Finally,
the recipes the user enters, along with their nutritional information, are saved to a file on their computer.
